# Academic Research Assistance System


## Description
A crucial part of academic research is comparing current work with previous studies (state-of-the-art review). This application streamlines this process by enabling researchers to input a research topic and receive relevant articles on the subject. Additionally, the system provides explanations on how existing work differs from the researcher's proposed ideas.

The system leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Large Language Models (LLM)** for document filtering and text generation.
